###Proactive Insights for Employee Well-being: Predicting Burnout with Machine Learning
##Capstone Project | NeuroWell Analytics
#Project Overview
Employee burnout is a growing global concern, affecting productivity, engagement, and mental health in the workplace. This project, built for NeuroWell Analytics, applies machine learning techniques to predict employee burnout using historical workplace and well-being data.
The goal is to help organizations take proactive action based on data-driven insights.

##Objectives
- Understand burnout trends using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Preprocess and engineer features to improve model performance
- Build regression models to predict employee Burn Rate
- Identify key burnout drivers using model interpretation
- Recommend interventions to reduce burnout and improve workplace wellness

##Dataset
#Files:
- train.csv — training dataset
- test.csv — testing dataset

##Features:

#Feature              	          Description
- Employee ID                 Unique identifier
- Date of Joining	            Start date at the company
- Gender	                     Male / Female
- Company                     Type	Service or Product company
- WFH Setup Available	        Whether proper remote setup exists
- Designation	                Seniority level
- Resource Allocation	        Hours assigned per day
- Mental Fatigue              Score	Self-reported fatigue level
- Burn Rate	                  Target variable (rate of burnout)

##Exploratory Data Analysis
- Burn Rate distribution shows moderate right skew
- High burnout is associated with higher mental fatigue and workload
- WFH setup appears to slightly reduce burnout rates
- Junior staff show higher burnout risk

##Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- Imputed missing values using median and mode
- Applied binary encoding to categorical variables (Gender, Company Type, WFH Setup)
- Extracted employee Tenure (in years) from Date of Joining
- Removed Employee ID as it is not predictive

##Model Development
#Models Tested:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

##Best Model: Tuned Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Metric	Value
- R²	0.9044
- RMSE	0.0603
- MAE	0.0474

##Key Features Driving Burnout
#Top predictors identified:
- Mental Fatigue Score
- Resource Allocation
- Tenure
- Designation

##Insight
High fatigue and workload are strong indicators of burnout. Newer employees and those in junior roles are more vulnerable. WFH setup has modest influence.

##Sample Prediction Output
- Employee ID	Predicted Burn Rate
- fffe31003300390039003000	0.6170
- fffe33003400380035003900	0.3670
- ...	...

##Recommendations
- Introduce fatigue tracking and wellness check-ins
- Rebalance workload for high-risk employees
- Promote flexible work options (e.g., WFH or hybrid)
- Strengthen onboarding and support for new employees

##Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for modeling and tuning)
- Jupyter Notebook
